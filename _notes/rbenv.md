`rbenv` is a tool that allows you to run multiple versions of ruby on your machine, and define per directory/project what the default version should be.

The installation instructions on their [Github page](github.com/rbenv/rbenv) are great; **BE SURE NOT TO FORGET TO RUN THE SHELL INTEGRATION TASKS, especially if you installed using Homebrew.**
