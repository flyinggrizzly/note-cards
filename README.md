# note-cards
A Jekyll theme for keeping notes and flashcards.

## Usage

Put your notes in the relevant collection directory, and make sure you add that directory to `_config.yml` if it's a new notebook.

It makes more sense for long-term maintainability to organize notes at directory level rather than relying on having Jekyll forever and using categories (an otherwise viable alternative). It's pretty academic though. Besides, search and the tag/category filters will pull anything together you need on the live site.

If you want to use the blog function, I recommend you use it as release-notes/change-log.
